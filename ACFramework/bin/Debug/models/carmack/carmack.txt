Model description       : This is a model of id genius, John Carmack.  I was
                        inspired to make this model after a friend of mine
                        (Darkness) said "hey, make a John Carmack model." So
                        I did.  I made him as low poly as possible, and tried
                        to focus attention to the skin and animations.  Since
                        Mr. Carmack is a legend, I figured others would like
                        to run about the levels as the man who made it all
                        possible.  And so I give you my John Carmack model.


Other info              : This is the first model that I have completed for
                        Quake2 (Player Model that is.)  So there are of
                        course some weak areas...but I know what they are!
                        My complaint is that i didnt take enough time to
                        build dummy objects for the joints.  I whipped this
                        model out in 5 days (while going to college) so I
                        didn't make it the best model around.  It's just a
                        fun model...period.  I hope you all enjoy!

                        I would have included sounds BUT, my only source for
                        sounds are 2 .MP2's that I got off the net which were
                        recently pulled because they were unauthorized.  I
                        felt it would be in bad taste to use materials that
                        "The Man" felt were not for the public.  I respect
                        John Carmack and so you'll have to live with the male
                        sounds.

                        Oh, and i you do get to see this model John, drop me
                        a line!  hehehe...thanx!
