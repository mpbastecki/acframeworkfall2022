Model Name              : Ostrich Man
installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/ostrich
Author                  : Lewis Mitchell

Model description       : A man riding on the back of an ostrich.
                          

Other info              : Before any of you ask, Ostrich man is not meant to be a Chocobo.
                          The original inspiration for him came from my brother who wanted
                          me to make a model of a guy riding a horse. I told him I thought
                          it would be a little impractical, but a man riding the back of an
                          ostrich might be do-able. It was only afterwards I realised just
                          how chocobo-ish the whole idea was.
			  For those of you who are interested, the sound of the ostrich is
			  actually the sound of a Scarlet Macaw. I did manage to get my hands on a
			  tape of an ostrich but they sound so stupid I didn't think you would
			  mind a little bit of creative licence on my part. Besides, everyone
			  I asked didn't know what an ostrich sounded like anyway.
